# OmniOne Digital ID

**OmniOne Digital ID** is an open source project that aims to drive global adoption and expansion of self-sovereign identity through a secure identity system based on the technology that built the Republic of Korea's national mobile ID.

**OmniOne Digital ID** is an open source decentralized identifier (DID) designed to provide developers with the tools they need to integrate self-sovereign identity management into their applications, built to be secure, scalable, and interoperable by adhering to the latest DID standards.

## Goals

- We aim to provide a digital identity authentication system through the OPEN DID platform based on trust and responsibility to various members of the digital world.
- Through this, we reduce social costs and enable the socially excluded from the infrastructure to fulfill their “social responsibility for realizing human values.”

## Project Structure

- **Decentralized**: No reliance on a central authority, empowering users with full control over their digital identities.
- **Standards-Compliant**: Implements W3C DID standards to ensure compatibility across platforms.
- **Interoperable**: Supports multiple DID methods, making it easy to integrate with various blockchain networks.
- **Secure**: Focused on privacy and security, ensuring that users' identities are protected.
